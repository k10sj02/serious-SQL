# Has anyone ever made a cohort analysis pivot table on a quarterly rather than monthly basis?
# I'm working on that in SQL (MySQL 5.7.12) and I can get each of the quarters (Q2 '23, Q3 '23, etc.) 
# in the column label, but I'm actually wondering now if each of the instances across the row headers should represent billing months or billing quarters## The only reason I'm making this quarterly cohort analysis anyway is because a client asked for itÂ 
# in addition to the regular monthly cohort analysis?

    -- This column calculates the quarter in which the delivery occurred, formatted as 'Q[Quarter]-YYYY'

-- Explanation: This SQL query calculates a cumulative sum of the volume column by adding the previous volume amounts to a running total.

-- Define a common table expression (CTE) named 'cum_sum' to select the market_date and volume from the 'updated_daily_btc' table, ordered by market_date, and limit the result to 10 rows.
WITH cum_sum AS (
  SELECT
    market_date,
    volume
  FROM updated_daily_btc
  ORDER BY market_date
  LIMIT 10
)
-- Select the market_date and volume columns from the 'cum_sum' CTE, and calculate the running total of volume by summing the volumes of all previous rows, using an inner join between 'cum_sum' aliased as 't1' and 't2' with a condition that market_date of 't1' is greater than or equal to market_date of 't2'.
SELECT 
  t1.market_date,
  t1.volume,
  SUM(t2.volume) AS running_total
FROM cum_sum t1
INNER JOIN cum_sum t2
ON t1.market_date >= t2.market_date
/*The ON t1.market_date >= t2.market_date line in the SQL query specifies the condition for joining 
the two instances of the cum_sum CTE (common table expression) named t1 and t2.
In this specific context, t1.market_date >= t2.market_date ensures that for each row in t1, it is 
joined with all the rows in t2 where the market_date value in t1 is greater than or equal to the market_date value in t2.*/
GROUP BY 1,2
ORDER BY 1,2;
